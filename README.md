# SimpleOpenWeatherKT
Simple Weather App that I have built due to some spare time, to keep myself in touch with Kotlin since it has been a while since I've last struck some serious code in that context.

The app uses free account of [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## Main technology used
- **ConstraintLayout**: A layout that allows us to create large and complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy (no nested view groups). 
- **Scalable Vector Drawables**: SVG vector graphics that allow significant reduction of the APK and app size, compared to bitmap resources.
- **Retrofit 2.0**: A type-safe HTTP client, that is used to comunicate with the designated API.
- **RxJava/RxKotlin**: A Kotlin implementation of Reactive Extensions. For composing asynchronous sequences of code, and implementing a reactive/asynchronous programming concept.
- **Dagger 2**: A dependency injection framework. We use it to implement a design pattern with minimal burden of writing the boilerplate code.
- **Architecture Components**: A collection of libraries that help us design robust, testable, and maintainable apps. Mainly used for data persistance and lifecycle awareness. (LiveData was not used, I have decide in favor of Rx Flowables, Singles and Completables)
  - **ViewModel**: Class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. Used store the UI related data so it survives the device rotation
  - **Room**: A SQLite object mapping library. Used to Avoid boilerplate code and easily convert SQLite table data to Java objects.
- **AndroidX**: The open-source project that is a major improvement to the original Android Support Library.

## Important
In order for the app to work you need to provide your own **APP ID** from https://openweathermap.org, in ```api/OpenWeatherApi.java```. A free plan will work with this app.
